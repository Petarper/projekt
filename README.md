# testing 
Making a simple data scraper that gets temperature and feels like temperature
puts it into an sqlite3 
and does predictions based on it
and i have to dockerise it

the goal is just to learn concepts (git, web scraping, docker) and practices the ones i know


project is done
just do docker-compose build and docker-compose up

it runs on localhost:5000

future ideas:
  - peg it to the same db so its all shared
  - the file is waaay to big fix it
odds of future ideas happening: nonzero but very close to it
